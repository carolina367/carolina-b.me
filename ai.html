    <h1>Data Science Concepts</h1>
    <h2>Machine Learning</h2>
    <p>
      Machine Learning is a subset of AI that provides systems the ability to
      learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

    <h2>Deep Learning</h2>
    <p>
      Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning that uses neural networks
      with many layers (deep neural networks) to model and understand complex
      patterns.<a

    <h2>Data Mining</h2>
    <p>
      Data Mining is the process of discovering patterns and knowledge from
      large amounts of data. It's about extracting useful information from the
      data.

    <h2>Data Visualization</h2>
    <p>
      Data Visualization is the graphical representation of data and information
      using visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps.

    <h2>Big Data</h2>
    <p>
      Big Data refers to extremely large data sets that may be analyzed
      computationally to reveal patterns, trends, and associations, especially
      relating to human behavior and interactions.

    <h2>Statistical Analysis</h2>
    <p>
      Statistical Analysis involves collecting and scrutinizing every data
      sample in a set of items from which samples can be drawn. It could be any
      collection of data or information that is set out to test theories or make
      estimates to forecast future trends.

    <h2>Data Engineering</h2>
    <p>
      Data Engineering involves the application of software engineering
      principles to the design and creation of systems that process large
      amounts of data, and the transformation and storage of this data.

    <h2>Natural Language Processing</h2>
    <p>
      Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of AI that focuses on the
      interaction between computers and humans through natural language. The
      goal of NLP is to read, decipher, understand, and make sense of human
      language in a valuable way.

    <h2>Computer Vision</h2>
    <p>
      Computer Vision is a field of AI that trains computers to interpret and
      understand the visual world. Using digital images from cameras and videos
      and deep learning models, machines can accurately identify and classify
      objects and then react to what they "see."

    <h2>Business Intelligence</h2>
    <p>
      Business Intelligence (BI) refers to the procedural and technical
      infrastructure that collects, stores, and analyzes data produced by a
      companyâ€™s activities. BI is a broad term that encompasses data mining,
      process analysis, performance benchmarking, and descriptive analytics.

    <h2>Generative AI</h2>
    <p>
      Generative AI is one of the biggest recent advancements in artificial
      intelligence technology because of its ability to create something new. It
      opens the door to an entire world of possibilities for human and computer
      creativity, with practical applications emerging across industries, from
      turning sketches into images for accelerated product development, to
      improving computer-aided design of complex objects.
