        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          I am a fourth-year Texas A&M engineering student pursuing a BA in
          Computing with a focus in Data Engineering. I possess a diverse skill
          set through various roles and relevant coursework such as Data
          Structures and Algorithms, Programming Languages, and Introduction to
          Program Design and Concepts. During my internship at Atlassian, skills
          such as my attention to detail led me to discover bugs and improve
          design patterns. I excel in customer relations, team collaboration, and
          communication. My extracurricular interests include making and
          appreciating art, reading, and traveling. I'm always looking for
          opportunities to connect with like-minded individuals!
