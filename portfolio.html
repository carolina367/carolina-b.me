          <h2>** Third Place App **</h2>
          <p>
            The concept of the "third place," as coined by Ray Oldenburg in
            <a
              href="https://archive.org/details/greatgoodplaceca00olde_2/page/n9/mode/2up"
              target="_blank"
              >The Great Goodplace</a
            >, refers to social environments distinct from the conventional
            settings of home and the workplace. These spaces play a crucial role
            in fostering community, social interaction, and a sense of belonging.
            Examples include cafes, bars, community centers, libraries, and other
            locales where people gather beyond their homes and workplaces.
          </p>
          <p>
            In essence, the third place serves as a vital component for a
            well-rounded and fulfilling life, complementing the private sphere of
            home and the professional realm of work. It is characterized by
            inclusivity and sociability, providing individuals with opportunities
            for casual encounters, discussions, and shared experiences.
          </p>
          <p>
            I would like to create an extension to google maps that can identify
            these spaces and describe their atmosphere. I particularly would want
            it to have indicators of if there are paywalls to be there. I often
            find it hard when I'm in a new city to find good places to study since
            there is not one word that encompasses all the different types of
            study vibes. This is a planned pursuit.

        <div class="current-viewing" id="project2" style="display: none;">
          <h2>** Automated Blinds **</h2>
          <p>
            Transforming my blinds into smart, motorized systems involves selecting
            blinds suitable for motorization, like roller or corded blinds. After
            choosing a DC motor that matches the blinds' size and weight, I will
            integrate it with a motor controller. Power will be supplied through a
            battery or plug-in source, and I'll opt for a convenient control
            system—remote, app, or smart home integration. Installation includes
            attaching the motor, concealing wires for a tidy look, and ensuring
            safety. Thorough testing guarantees seamless response to control
            commands. Optionally, sensors for automated adjustments based on
            environmental conditions are considered. The final touch involves
            securing the blinds and motor, with compatibility for integration into
            existing smart home setups.

          <h2>SHPE Mobile App</h2>
          <p>
            Solidarity is very important to me and I prioritize seeking out
            communities that I resonate with such as women and latinos in STEM.
            During my time in school, I joined
            <a href="https://www.tamushpe.org/">SHPE</a>, Society of Hispanic
            Professional Engineers. In Texas, everything is bigger and my chapter is
            huge, over 730 active members. There was a need for a better way to
            manage the point system and disseminate information, so a mobile app
            development team was created. Thorough this team I have been building my
            skills in javascript and react and branching into UI/UX design.

              target="_blank"
            > Battleship </a>
            game was crafted using Java with a JavaFX GUI. The game mirrors the
            strategic essence of the classic Battleship, challenging players to
            locate their adversary’s fleet on a grid. The GUI, designed for clarity
            and ease of use, provides a visually appealing interface. Single-player
            mode is available, pitting users against a computer opponent powered by
            a strategic algorithm. The codebase is structured and commented for
            potential future enhancements. This project serves as a testament to
            proficiency in Java and JavaFX, demonstrating the ability to create an
            interactive and engaging digital version of a classic game.

              >
              at Atlassian, I was involved in several significant projects. One of the
              key initiatives was the transformation of release notes into a more
              user-friendly format, aligning with Atlassian’s customer-centric
              approach. Another major task was the integration of Contentful with the
              Atlassian support website. This integration allowed us to separate
              content from the UI, simplifying the content authoring process and
              enhancing content reuse. Additionally, I was responsible for the
              implementation of SeaPuppy as a content gateway. This strategic
              implementation improved scalability and performance, and laid the
              groundwork for its potential use across multiple Atlassian products.

              Consolidated 30 million user accounts across company products with
              Atlassian SSO to increase cross-platform accessibility. Implemented an
              advanced search feature to enable searchability of cards amongst a
              user’s personal Trello boards, reducing the need to manually search
              content.

          <h2>First Website</h2>

          My inaugural website was a venture into the world of web development,
          hosted on <a href="https://www.pythonanywhere.com/">Python Anywhere</a>. 
          Embracing Bootstrap for its design elements,
          the site centered around promoting recycling initiatives in Austin.
          Although the project is no longer accessible due to account inactivity,
          it marked the initiation of my coding journey.
          </p>
          <p>
            The site showcased my early proficiency in front-end development,
            leveraging Bootstrap's responsive framework to create an aesthetically
            pleasing and user-friendly interface. By focusing on a local issue like
            recycling, the project aimed to raise awareness and encourage
            sustainable practices within the Austin community.

          <h2>Hello World</h2>
          <p>
            In my sophomore year of high school, I took my first step into coding
            with a simple "Hello, World!" program. Surprising myself, I never
            anticipated diving into programming, yet this initial foray marked the
            start of a journey into the world of coding and technology.
